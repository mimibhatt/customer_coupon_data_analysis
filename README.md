# Introduction 
This project is an assignment for the AI/ ML certification course offered by UC Berkeley. In this project, I am analyzing the data set using various analytical tools to answer the question "Will a customer accept the coupon"

# Pre-requisites 
The libraries used in the code are:
Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.pyplot

# Data
The data set is survey data that describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).
